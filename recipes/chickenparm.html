      </li>
      <li>
        Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes. <img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/nOH8tE5-CvCdfFphVNrGnEAg81g=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/223042-Chicken-Parmesan-mfs-Step6_005-028adbb5380b4992b8c5b9334b35cb0d.jpg" alt="Chicken being dipped in eggs and then in breadcrumbs">
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven. <img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/GF99CGA9KpnUtif1i2sDdGJvx_I=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/223042-Chicken-Parmesan-mfs-Step7_006-3e59039761c248458efb926b2614c333.jpg" alt="Chicken being friend in pan of olive oil">
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil. <img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/LD9gCZLz-0ujzhosIlBgR27YCRw=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/223042-Chicken-Parmesan-mfs-Step9_010-1fd8f7e6ea7040e6bba0859d173c5608.jpg" alt="Chicken in baking dish with tomato sauce dolloped on each breast, then mozzarella sprinkled on top"></li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
